				<h3><b>Lincoln-Douglas Debate (LD)</b></h3>
				<p>Lincoln Douglas debate is a one-on-one debate that is focused on philosophy and logic.  The debate topics change every two months and are based on what is morally right or wrong. Lincoln Douglas heightens proficiency in speaking, argumentation, and research. Lincoln-Douglas debaters, with their experience in rebuttal delivery and speech writing, soon become well versed in philosophy and become more fluent and confident speakers.</p>

				<h3><b>Public Forum Debate (PF)​​</b></h3>
				<p>Public Forum Debate is audience friendly debate. Two pairs (teams) debate monthly controversial topics ripped from newspaper headlines.
